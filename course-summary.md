### Another Example of multi Variate time Series 


<br>

 A multi-variate time series chart can be a helpful way to understanding the impact of related data.

  Also consider this chart showing the global temperature against CO2 concentration

## Machine learning applied to time series


- Prediction of forecasting based on the data 
- Project back into the past ( Imputation ) to see how we get where we are now 

**with Imputation, we can fill the missing data in the timeframe**


## Common patterns in time series

<br>



![Triend Time Series ](triend-ts.png)
### `Trends`, where the time series have a specific direction to move

<br>
<br>

![Triend Time Series ](seasonality-ts.png)

### `Seasonality`, which is seen when patterns repeat at predictable intervals


<br>
<br>
<br>


![Sess And Triend ](ses-triend.png)

###  Some time series can have a combination of both trend and seasonality as this chart shows

###  some that are probably not predictable at all and just a complete set of random values
